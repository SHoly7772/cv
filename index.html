            <p>I have over 22 years of consulting, climbing and field arboriculture work. I am a strong team player with
                demonstrated ability to
                work well in a group work environment. A heavy equipment operator throughout my entire career starting
                in the
                Military, including tanks, APCs, and multiple types of large trucks. I decided to have a change in
                career, in
                the spring of 2021. I jumped head first into the world of Tech.
                I started my journey learning Data and from there I discovered RPA (Robotic Process Automation).
                Shortly there after I came across Web Development, which has lead me to creating this web page about
                myself.
